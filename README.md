## 🎨 Design Philosophy

> *"The most powerful photographs aren't posed — they're felt."*

This website is designed with the same philosophy. Every interaction, from the floating gold particles to the 3D-tilting service cards, is crafted to evoke the feeling of luxury and artistry that a premium photography studio represents.

**Key design decisions:**
- **Playfair Display** for headings — an editorial serif that instantly communicates luxury
- **Gold (#C9A24B)** as the accent color — the universal signifier of premium quality
- **Always-dark footer** — a photography industry convention that feels editorial
- **Asymmetric layouts** — break the monotony of uniform grids to create visual interest
- **Restraint in animation** — all animations are under 400ms and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
