          <p>
            If {siteConfig.name} cannot perform this Agreement due to fire or other casualty, strike, act of God, or other cause beyond the control of the parties, or due to Photographer&rsquo;s illness or emergency, then the Photographer shall return the retainer fee to the Client but shall have no further liability with respect to the Agreement.
